# Annotation Guidelines

The annotation guidelines we provided to the annotators in this work were strongly inspired by the work developed by Basile et al (2019) with minor modifications. As all anotators were Spanish native speakers, the original guidelines were provided in Spanish. However, we include the English translation as a reference for the community.
