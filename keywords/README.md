# Keyword sets for data collection

We define three lists of keywords related to immigration and hate speech towards immigrants in order to filter data. In other words, each of the extracted tweets should contain at least one of the listed keywords. Two sets of keywords contain 73 and 18 terms regarding European and Latin American immigration, respectively. In addition, the third set of keywords comprises 26 generic terms related to immigration â€“i.e., such terms are not region-specific. The terms are mainly demonyms, country names, and nicknames (offensive or not) related to such regions. Moreover, we also considered terms containing typos (avoiding conflicts among homograph words) to to increase the number of relevant results. Note that in our work we considered immigration from certain African and Latin American countries to Spain as well as immigration from Venezuela to certain Latin America countries, since such immigration scenarios have shown a rise of xenophobic behavior in online micro-blogging platforms.
